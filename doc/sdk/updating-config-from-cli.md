The `updateconfig` command line operation can be used to update a previously
provisioned client with the latest information from a management server
(ePO or OpenDXL Broker).

> **Note:** ePO-managed environments must have 4.0 (or newer) versions of
> DXL ePO extensions installed.

The `updateconfig` operation performs the following:

* Retrieves the latest CA certificate bundle from the server and stores it
  at the file referenced by the `BrokerCertChain` setting in the `[Certs]`
  section of the ``dxlclient.config`` file.

* Retrieves the latest broker information and updates the `[Brokers]`
  section of the `dxlclient.config` file with that information.

### Basic Example

For example:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/dxlclient updateconfig config myserver
```

For this example, `config` is the name of the directory in which the
`dxlclient.config` file resides and `myserver` is the hostname or IP address of
ePO or an OpenDXL Broker.

When prompted, provide credentials for the OpenDXL Broker Management Console
or ePO (the ePO user must be an administrator):

```sh
Enter server username:
Enter server password:
```

If the operation is successful, output similar to the following
should be displayed:

```sh
Updating certs in config/ca-bundle.crt
Updating DXL config file at config/dxlclient.config
```

To avoid the username and password prompts, supply the appropriate
command line options (`-u` and `-p`):

```sh
node_modules/.bin/dxlclient updateconfig config myserver -u myuser -p mypass
```

### Additional Options

The update operation assumes that the default web server port is 8443,
the default port under which the ePO web interface and OpenDXL Broker Management
Console is hosted.

A custom port can be specified via the `-t` option.

For example:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/dxlclient updateconfig config myserver -t 443
```

If the management server's CA certificate is stored in a local CA truststore
file &mdash; one or more PEM-formatted certificates concatenated together into a
single file &mdash; the update operation can be configured to validate
the management server's certificate against that truststore during TLS session
negotiation by supplying the `-e` option.

The name of the truststore file should be supplied along with the option:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/dxlclient updateconfig config myserver -e config/ca-bundle.crt
```
